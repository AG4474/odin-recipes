    <p>If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a juicy, perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast, this recipe is for you. 
    Here are some tips from Chef John to get you started</p>
    <h2>Prime Rib Tips</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>This simple, foolproof "mathematical method" for making the very best prime rib will greatly increase your chances of success. 
        Here is the formula: <strong>Multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.</strong> For me it was 5.35 x 5 = 26.75 minutes, which we round up to 27</li>
        <li>You'll cook your room-temperature prime rib at 500 degrees F for exactly that many minutes. (Twenty-seven minutes, in my case.) 
        Then turn off the oven and <strong>wait 2 hours without opening the door.</strong> 
        When the time's up, remove the prime rib and slice into the most perfectly medium-rare meat you've ever seen. See? 
        That's all it takes to make foolproof prime rib cooked to a perfect pink that's somewhere just a shade under medium rare. </li>
        <li><strong>Just make sure you're starting with a prime rib that has been brought to room temperature!</strong> 
        This is critical in order for the math to work!</li>
        <li>Serve your prime rib with Chef John's Beef Au Jus and Horseradish Sauce.</li>
